# Website

This is a basic, responsive personal website built using HTML and CSS. The current idea is to build a portfolio website. It features a navigation bar, a neon button effect, and looping video as backgroud. The site also includes responsive design for mobile and tablet screens.
The project is incomplete as I was unable to position the main button on the homepage and I am yet to develop all the pages further. This is my first attempt of developing a website hence faced challenges with various parts. 

How to use:
I developed the code on vscode and I run the code using the extension live server.

Important note: The website is incomplete, I have only meet the requirements for the first hand-in.
